Indexhibit is a pioneering, influential, web-based content management system (CMS), founded in 2006 by Jeffery Vaska and Daniel Eatock, which is used primarily to create online portfolios (image, text and video).
It is intended for independent-minded creators, academics, researchers, students, collectors, et al., who wish to learn how and manage the visual display of their works, on their own terms, according to their own abilities.
